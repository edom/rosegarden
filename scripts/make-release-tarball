Usage: $myname [TARGET]

Must run from a valid rosegarden/ directory.  Examines the current directory to
determine where it resides in the Subversion repository (typically
branches/stable_YY_MM for release candidates) and pulls a clean copy from there.
Bootstraps the fresh checkout and performs some preparatory cleanups, then
leaves rosegarden-[VERSION]-[TARGET].tar.bz2 ready for release.

VERSION - extracted from source

TARGET  - assumes that configure.ac already has the correct version in the
          AC_INIT call and the codename has been set on the CODENAME= line; use
          the target "RELEASE" for a final release or a release candidate (as
          opposed to an alpha, beta, pre, etc.)

Example: $myname alpha-2

cat > CONTRIBUTING << EOF
This source tree is a release version that has been stripped of version-control
information in order to reduce its size.  If you wish to submit a patch to fix a
bug or add a new feature, PLEASE do not begin working from this directory!

It is very difficult to use patches built against a release source tree, and we
have had to reject some otherwise excellent patches due to their being built
against a release tree so old and so far removed from the current development
line that it was almost impossible to do anything with them.

Please don't let this happen to you.  To learn about the recommended way to
contribute patches, please see:
